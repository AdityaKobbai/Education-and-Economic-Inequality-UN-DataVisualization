## 1. Problem Statement
Achieving inclusive and quality education for all and its effect on economic inequality.

## 2. Target Audience
Policy Makers, Economists, Educators, Researchers, NGOs, Education Advocates.

## 3. Analysis of Data

### Tableau Dashboard
We have developed a Tableau Dashboard to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between income distribution and primary school enrollment rates. The interactive tool enables stakeholders to quickly assess the 'Income share held by the lowest 20% of the population of a particular nation in a particular year' and examine the corresponding trends in 'Primary School Enrolment (% gross)'.

#### Observations
While the correlation between primary school enrollment and economic indicators is particularly evident in the case of underdeveloped nations across Asia and Africa, the opposite trend is emerging for developing nations. Despite the positive impact observed in numerous countries, focusing on increasing 'Primary School Enrollment (% gross)' is proving to be less effective in reducing economic inequality in these developing contexts.

##### Example: India from 1983 through 2011
In India, despite a significant improvement in 'Primary School Enrollment (% gross)' from 1983 to 2011, with consistent progress observed each year in between, this positive trend did not translate into a reduction in income inequalities. In fact, the disparity increased, as the income share of the bottom 20% decreased from 8.5% to 8.1% during these years, which is cause for concern. This may be attributed to factors such as unemployment and disparities in the quality of education received, highlighting the widening gap between the privileged and the underprivileged.

## 4. Actionable Insights
- Governments must prioritize equal access to quality education for all citizens to bridge disparities effectively.
- Governments should prioritize policies that foster inclusive economic growth and provide equal opportunities for all citizens.
